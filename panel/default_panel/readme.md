# two_point_one_colorizer default_panel notes

- the mounting holes fit m3 screws
- 25mm screws will fit front_panel, pcb and back_plate
- the front_panel mounts to pcb with 12mm standoffs
- the optional svideo footprint is not cut out on panel by default
- small slide switches to set pal/ntsc are too low to be hand switched with panel on - can still be set with tool such as screwdriver
- the default potentiometers in underscores BOMs have 12mm shaft lengths - consider replacing these with >17mm shaft length alternatives if you plan to use it with a panel
